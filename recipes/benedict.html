    <h2><u>Directions</u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>To Make the Hollandaise:</strong> Fill the bottom of a double boiler part-way with water.
            Make sure that water does not touch the top pan. Bring water to a gentle simmer. In the top of the double boiler, whisk
            together egg yolks, lemon juice, white pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and 1 tablespoon water.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add the melted butter to egg yolk mixture 1 or 2 tablespoons at a time while whisking yolks constantly. 
            If hollandaise begins to get too thick, add a teaspoon or two of hot water. Continue whisking until all 
            butter is incorporated. Whisk in salt, then remove from heat. Place a lid on pan to keep sauce warm.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Preheat oven to broiler setting. <br><strong> To Poach Eggs:</strong> Fill a large saucepan with 3 inches of water. 
            Bring water to a gentle simmer, then add vinegar. Carefully break eggs into simmering water, and allow to cook 
            for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Yolks should still be soft in center. Remove eggs from water with a slotted spoon and set on a warm plate.</li>
        <br>
        <li>While eggs are poaching, brown the bacon in a medium skillet over medium-high heat and toast the English muffins on a baking sheet under the broiler.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Spread toasted muffins with softened butter, and top each one with a slice of bacon, followed by one poached egg. Place 2 muffins on each 
            plate and drizzle with hollandaise sauce. Sprinkle with chopped chives and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
